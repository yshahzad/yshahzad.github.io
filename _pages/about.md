Welcome to my website! My name is Yavuz, and I am an undergraduate at McGill University. I study statistics (with a minor in psychology) and am particularly interested in applications of statistics and machine learning to biomedical and health sciences. 
I encourage you to read about my research with the [Brain Research and Imaging for Neurorehabilitation (BRAIN) Lab](https://boudriaslab.com/), which has so far focused on evaluating a novel treatment modality for those with chronic stroke. This coming summer, thanks to funding from NSERC, my work will center the problem of identifying vascular and metabolic biomarkers of stroke impairment using quantitative MRI.

If you are interested in learning about the more laid-back, creative projects I have worked on, I encourage you to check out the “Personal Projects” section of the site. I hope you enjoy learning about my work!
