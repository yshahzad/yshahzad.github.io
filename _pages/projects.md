[MILO](https://yshahzad.github.io/projects/milo) is an exercise tracker (in progress) for people with simultaneous goals of improving their cardiovascular fitness and strength. It is built in Python (Flask, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy), and will  connect to the Strava API to read users' pre-existing running, hiking, or cycling data. Users can manually enter strength training and cardiovascular training data, and MILO provides a useful overview of statistics related to the user's fitness progress.
