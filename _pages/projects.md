InsideRadar:
---
InsideRadar is an insider trading detection platform on Polymarket. We (my friends Andrew, Angadh, and I) built an XGBoost model and a real-time data pipeline to flag bets likely influenced by insider information, using Polars, SQLAlchemy, FastAPI, Scikit-learn, and NetworkX. This work is in progress: more to come soon!

ProfSight McGill: 
---
[ProfSight](https://yshahzad.github.io/projects/class-avg) is an interactive data dashboard that aims to help undergraduates at McGill University make informed choices about their degree planning. It is built using Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Plotly) and hosted on Streamlit.
