## [The BRAIN Lab](https://boudriaslab.com/)

As an undergraduate researcher in McGill's Brain Research and Imaging for Neurorehabilitation Lab (BRAIN Lab), I focused on chronic stroke recovery and neural correlates of Long COVID, with an emphasis on computational analysis of behavioral and EEG data. Relevant publication: [Long-term benefits of a tailored strength training intervention on arm function in chronic stroke survivors: a follow-up study](https://doi.org/10.2340/jrm-cc.v8.42941).
