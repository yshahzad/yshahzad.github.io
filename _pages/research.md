## [The BRAIN Lab](https://boudriaslab.com/)

In the year and a half I worked as an undergraduate researcher for the Brain Research and Imaging for Neurorehabiliation Lab, under the supervision of Dr. Marie-Hélène Boudrias, my research focused on two main
categories:

### Chronic Stroke Recovery
An individual who had a stroke longer than 90 days ago is said to have chronic stroke. In previous literature, patients 
in this phase of recovery are considered to have reduced potential to recover from any post-stroke motor deficits.
In this paper, we showed that a *tailored strength-training paradigm* that individualized participants' training based 
on the severity of their impairment improved outcomes for individuals with chronic stroke. 

I was responsible for the cleaning and analysis of data (in R), reviewing field-specific literature, and drafting a 
manuscript for publication. See here for [my code](https://github.com/yshahzad/TST-Longitudinal-BRAIN), and here for the paper (coming soon!).

### Neural Correlates of Long-COVID
Although clinical definitions are currently under debate within the scientific community, Long COVID is 
generally considered to be a condition characterized by a wide range of symptoms that persist or emerge four weeks 
(or longer) after the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. Many of these symptoms are psychological in nature, including 
chronic fatigue, memory disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and post-exertional malaise.

I have assisted with the collection of electroencephalogram (EEG) data in a study that compared the motor signalling 
and response of individuals with Long COVID to healthy control participants. I am currently working on adapting code
to characterize the behavior of Beta Bursts in these participants — a measure which has been empirically shown to
correlate with aging of the brain.
