ProfSight is an interactive data dashboard that aims to help undergraduates at McGill University make informed choices about their degree planning. The dashboard has two main components; the first ("Search by Course") displays historical student performance data of a user-specified McGill course, incorporating helpful information about differences in professors' difficulty levels. The second ("Search by Prof") displays summarizing information about a user-specified instructor at McGill.

The project uses historical data on class averages by course crowdsourced from by McGill community. It makes use of webscraping methods to collect information about instructors' teaching history and manipulates the data using Pandas. The dashboard is written using and hosted on the Streamlit platform.
