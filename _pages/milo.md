Many people have goals to both improve their cardiovascular fitness, through running, walking, and/or cycling, and simultaneously improve their strength and muscle tone 
through resistance training. 

For these folks, resources to help them keep track of their fitness progress are irreparably separate: existing weightlifting trackers cannot account for one's 
cardio workouts, while GPS-based apps for cycling, hiking, and running cannot track weightlifting. The result is an atomistic and incomplete picture of one's fitness progress, 
since one's performance in the weight room and on the trails are deeply interconnected.

MILO offers a holistic picture of one's overall fitness by centralizing these data, offering unique insights to users about their cardiovascular training, weight training, 
and the interaction between the two. 

The name MILO is inspired by Milo of Croton, an athlete and wrestler of Ancient Greece. He is said to have carried across his shoulders a calf, every day, 
from its infancy until it became a fully-grown bull, embodying the spirit of progressive overload that MILO aims to track.
