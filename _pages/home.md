Welcome to my website! My name is Yavuz, and I am an undergraduate at McGill University. I study statistics (with a minor in psychology) and am particularly interested in novel applications of statistics and machine learning to the health sciences and the financial services industry. 

I encourage you to read about my previous research with the [Brain Research and Imaging for Neurorehabilitation (BRAIN) Lab,](https://yshahzad.github.io/research/). My work at the lab has centered evaluating a novel treatment modality for those with chronic stroke, and has explored the neural underpinnings of post-COVID-19 syndrome. 

If you are interested in learning about the more self-directed, creative projects I have worked on, I encourage you to check out the “Personal Projects” section of the site. I hope you enjoy learning about my work!
