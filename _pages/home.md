Welcome to my website! My name is Yavuz, and I am an undergraduate at McGill University. I study statistics (with a minor in psychology) and am particularly interested in novel applications of statistics and machine learning to the health sciences. 

I encourage you to read about my research with the [Brain Research and Imaging for Neurorehabilitation (BRAIN) Lab](https://yshahzad.github.io/research/) and the D3Mod Lab. My work at the BRAIN Lab focused on chronic stroke recovery and the neural underpinnings of post-COVID-19 syndrome, while my current work in the MCHI applies machine learning to optimize the blood donation process. 

If you are interested in learning about the more self-directed, creative projects I have worked on, I encourage you to check out the “Personal Projects” section of the site. I hope you enjoy learning about my work!
