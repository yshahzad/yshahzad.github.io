I plan to be an undergraduate TA for three 100-level math courses at McGill, beginning in the fall of 2024. If you are a student of MATH 133 (Linear Algebra and Geometry), 
MATH 140 (Calculus I), or MATH 141 (Calculus II), you might find the below resources useful. These are forthcoming and will include, with instructor permission, 
handouts and supplementary material to lecture contents. Check back soon.
